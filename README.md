## When and where

- **Date:** 29 March 2019

<br/>
<br/>

## Getting ready

This will be an active learning assignment, which will make use of the Python programming language in combination with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which you should install (or already have) on the laptop that you bring to the course.

I have prepared some instructions for setting up your environment so that you come prepared and so that we donâ€™t spend precious time on these preparations during the assignment. Please follow the instructions. These instructions should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.



<br/>

**Step 1:**

If you do not already have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your machine (Hint: If you are unsure, go ahead and install a fresh copy), follow this link to download Miniconda and install the right package for your OS (Windows, Linux, or MacOS): 

https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Irrespective of your OS, I recommend the 64-bit Python 3.7 version. Installation should be straightforward (choose default install location), but inludes agreeing to the license terms (mark/type 'yes').



<br/>

**Step 2:**

Regardless whether you just installed Miniconda or are using an already existing conda environment, create a new environment by typing the following command in your terminal ('Anaconda Prompt' on Windows):

```shell
conda create -n teach -c conda-forge -y python=3.7
```

And activate this new environment with:

```shell
conda activate teach
```


<br/>

**Step 3:**

Now install the packages needed to be able to run the notebook. In case your running MacOS or linux, use the following command:

```shell
conda config --add channels conda-forge && conda install -y ipython \
    tornado=5.1.1 jupyter notebook ipywidgets numpy scipy numba pandas \
    gdal netcdf4 matplotlib basemap basemap-data-hires pillow obspy
```
In case your running Windows, use the following command in your Anaconda Prompt (without the back slashes):
```shell
conda config --add channels conda-forge && conda install -y ipython tornado=5.1.1 jupyter notebook ipywidgets numpy scipy numba pandas gdal netcdf4 matplotlib basemap basemap-data-hires pillow obspy
```

Installation may take a couple of minutes and will result in many other packages being installed as conda takes care of the dependencies for you.


<br/>

**Step 4:**

Test your environment:

You should now be good-to-go. To verify this, please type jupyter-notebook in the Terminal (or 'Anaconda Prompt'). A browser window should open and you should be able to start a new Python 3 Notebook:

If you were able to start a new Python 3 Notebook, you are indeed good-to-go for this Thursday. In case you got stuck somewhere in the process above, I will either let you look over the shoulder of a colleague tomorrow or we will do some quick troubleshooting. We will start our session this Thursday with "the real deal", below.

<br/>
<br/>

## The real deal

At the top of this page (i.e., in the project), you can find a zip file dubbed "JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK.zip". Please download the zip file, unzip it, and store the content in a separate directory on you machine. In your terminal ('Anaconda Prompt' on Windows), go to this directory and type

```shell
    jupyter notebook Teach.ipynb
```

See you this Thursday,

Kees
